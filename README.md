# factordb - A Knowledge Database

factordb is a knowledge database written in Rust.

The design is heavily inspired by [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com).

> :warning: factordb is in a very early alpha state - don't use it for anything serious yet!

## Quickstart

See the [examples](./factordb/examples/) or the [tests](./factordb/src/tests.rs)
to see how to use the database.

More documentation will be written as the project matures.
